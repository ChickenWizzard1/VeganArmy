# VeganArmy

## A Minecraft Plugin for All Vegetarians



### Introduction

VeganArmy is a Minecraft Spigot plugin designed to add a touch of humor to your gameplay. This plugin is not meant to offend anyone but rather to playfully poke fun at stereotypes and misconceptions surrounding veganism. As the creator, I want to make it clear that I have nothing against vegetarians or vegans and respect their lifestyle choices.

### Installation

To install VeganArmy, simply download the .jar file and place it in your Minecraft server's "plugins" folder. Make sure to restart your server to activate the plugin.

### Usage

Once installed, VeganArmy will seamlessly integrate into your Minecraft gameplay. You'll start encountering the Vegan  Army ;)

### Contributing

We welcome contributions and suggestions from the Minecraft community. If you have ideas for new vegan-themed content or improvements to the plugin, please feel free to submit a pull request or open an issue on our GitHub repository.
